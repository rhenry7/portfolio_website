                        <h4>About</h4>

                        <br> Veghead is an application I developed using React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Adobe CC. This site was deployed using Github. The goal of this project was to allow vegan and vegetarian users an easier and friendlier experience
                        for finding restaurants catering to their specific diets. As a health conscious eater, and an advocate for healthy lifestyles overall, I enjoyed creating an application that will help users achieve their goals.
